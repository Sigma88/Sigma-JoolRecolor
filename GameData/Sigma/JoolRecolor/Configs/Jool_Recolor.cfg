		{
			@description = Jool is particularly known for being a rather large planet. Kerbalkind has longed to visit it since it was first spotted in the sky. Philosophers reason that the swirling planet must be a really nice place to visit, on account of its unmatched size. If you look at Jool through a telescope, it is fuzzy.
